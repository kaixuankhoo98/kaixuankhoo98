Hello! You have found the GitHub page for Kaixuan Khoo. I hope this is what you were looking for.

I am a current student at Imperial College London, studying an MSc in Computing Science.
I have a first class MSci in Chemistry with Medicinal Chemistry from Imperial too!

This is my page to store some of my university work so I can access it from both home and uni laptops, as well as a place for me to start some personal projects of my own.

Here are the things I am currently working on:
- C++
- Object-oriented programming in C++
- SQL and Databases
- Writing bots for discord (see my Discord_Bots repo)

If you feel the need to reach out to me, please don't hesitate to contact me on LinkedIn (@kaixuan.khoo) or by email (kaixuan.khoo.98@gmail.com).

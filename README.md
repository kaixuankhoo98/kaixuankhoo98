Hello! You have found the GitHub page for Kaixuan Khoo. I hope this is what you were looking for.

I am a software developer for [Content Guru](https://www.contentguru.com/en-gb/)

I have an MSc in Computing Science from Imperial College London.
I have a first class MSci in Chemistry with Medicinal Chemistry from Imperial too!


This is my page to store some of my university work so I can access it from both home and uni laptops, as well as a place for me to start some personal projects of my own.

Here are the things I am currently working on:
- Machine Learning in Python
- A Wordle-inspired game (and set of games)!
- Writing bots for discord (see my Discord_Bots repo)

If you feel the need to reach out to me, please don't hesitate to contact me on LinkedIn (@kaixuan.khoo) or by email (kaixuan.khoo.98@gmail.com).
